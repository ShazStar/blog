Screenshot as a proof ~~so y'all won't assume I'm just shit talking about it :))~~ OS running on ThinkPad T440p on a spare SSD of mine, already wiped it.

I've actually tried Windows 11 since its leaked ISO days and RTM/21H2 releases but have never been fond of it. Mainly because of its bizarre hardware requirements (I don't have any devices that's **officially** supported by Windows 11, yes I know I can bypass it.), secondly is its overall experience have been feel pretty much like a downgrade compared to Windows 10, and even as I decided to give 23H2 another chance and used it for few days on my personal computer, things does improve but overall is still not enough to justify the "update", hence I'll continue to stay on Windows 10.

If you really are interested in my takes, you may continue on reading this blog. But keep in mind things will change in future, this blog is written in time where Windows 11 23H2 is the latest release of Windows 11.

# What makes it so bad over Windows 10?

As much as I hate its unreasonable hardware requirements, it's actually not the main reason why I still don't upgrade to Windows 11.

I mostly hate Windows 11 for its less intuitive UI compared to its predecessor, removing core features as well as how a lot of things are a literal shitty web apps instead of actual good native apps anymore. I know some "core feature" are added back on later release but it's still not justifiable enough for me to move on.

Notes: With features that are added back on later release, I will mark strikethrough text on it.

**Core Feature Removal that I considered a downgrade over Windows 10**
Taskbar:
~~Drag and Drop~~ (Feature restored in 22H2)
Taskbar options on right-click menu: Only Taskbar Settings was available to access thru the menu, in 22H2 they added Task Manager option, still really limited.
Small Taskbar / Move Taskbar: I personally don't use these two, but I still considered it a downgrade.
~~Ungrouping items~~: I don't use this one personally. (Feature restored in 23H2)
Toolbar Feature Removal: I have used Net Speed Monitor and Battery Toolbar (Laptop: Lenovo Vantage / Battery Bar) on Windows 10, it's horrible that I can't use neither of those on 11 anymore.

Start Menu:
Surprisingly I actually don't have much complain about this, since Windows 11 actually restore those features I cared about.
~~Start Menu Folder~~ (Feature restored in 22H2)

Extra Notes: It's at least better now that you can resize pinned area compared to pre-22H2, but of fucking course Microsoft shove ads in that section. I still don't like the fact it takes extra click to get to the "All Apps" section, even on Windows Vista and 7 it will auto entered in if you have your cursor hovered on the button, and Windows 10 just defaults to have access once you opened Start Menu.

Right Click Menu on Desktop/Windows Explorer:
Put it in short words: Good Plan. Bad Execution.
Most option you would actually want to access now takes extra steps to get into. What the fuck?

**Experiences with the new features/changes that are still not on par or worse than how I modded my Windows 10 to behave what I wanted it to be**

Windows Explorer:
Yet another **Good Plan. Bad Execution.**, I'm grateful that they finally put in tabs feature on Windows 11 22H2, but why doesn't it support hot keys? This immediately turned me off. On macOS Finder is possible, even with Windows 10 + QTTabBar is possible too. Why? Also you can't even combine two separeted Windows Explorer window into one on 11, smh.

Stock Apps are now mostly powered by Web App instead of being actually a Native App:
Just why Microsoft? I want native app that prodive better integration instead of a shitty web apps replica that doesn't intergrate well with the system, less options and are also a fucking resource hog. And what's worse? Those shitty web app replica are also invading Windows 10 too, for example Windows Mail are replaced with that god. fucking. awful. Outlook App that can't even turn off auto start, doesn't even intergrate system notifications and worstly, interrupts you by its sudden pop up window in front of you.

## Final Thoughts

Actually, I know there are ways which could improve Windows 11's experience and thanks to those extensions help, I can actually live with Windows 11. But on the other hand, a good OS shouldn't need **that much** of extensions just to make it actually good to use, and its simply unaccaptable that it feels like a total downgrade compared to its predecessor. Which is why even to this day, I will continue holding onto Windows 10 until Microsoft actually make Windows 11 a worthy update for me to use, or I have simply run into unavoidable reasons. You had one job Microsoft. You had one. fucking. job. Microsoft.
