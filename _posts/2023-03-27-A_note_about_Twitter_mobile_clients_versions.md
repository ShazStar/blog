As someone who hate the new two row timeline that Twitter has been forcing on for three times and actually not going to change it back anytime soon (As it seems). I decided to make a note on Twitter mobile client versions that have major UI changes, it can also serve as a useful note for anyone who want to perform a downgrade (or update) on Twitter without trial and error. (?

# Twitter for iOS:

9.37.1 -> Last version without view counts.
9.39 -> Last version with old timeline and view counts.
9.40+ -> New two row timeline.

## Twitter for Android:

9.68.1 -> Last version without view counts.
9.69.1 -> Last version with old timeline and view counts.
9.70+ -> New two row timeline.
