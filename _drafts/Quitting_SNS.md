Few months ago, I decided to scrap all my SNS accounts out of anger. But after staying away for 2 months, I've got some thoughts about this.

Recently I've noticed the growing popularity of digital minimalism, although that's not what drags me into the rabbit hole. I have to put myself into focus for my uni semester and recently I've grown tired and frustrated at what SNS always brings me unnecessary stress and negativity, resulting me deactivated most of my SNS I used to use and moved to the other one I have as a backup.

SNS is a place where people share the best of themselves, for people who's not in the best mental condition, that caused an unnecessary amount of stress. Plus, corps nowadays are all trying to maximize your screen time on their platform, making you addicted and ended up "doomscrolling".

For what I do, moved to the backup accounts might sounds like you are just moved from one to the other and doesn't seems to help any. But the reality is, since my backup account doesn't follow anything that makes me "want" to look into, that eventually makes me not want to open their app/website anymore unless necessary.
