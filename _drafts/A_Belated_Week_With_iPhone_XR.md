It's quite an unexpected event of how I get this phone actually. This have to date back in Nov 28th, where someone in my family messaged me asking to help her friends selling 2 devices, one is iPad mini 2 and the other is iPhone XR. I accepted, and then got both devices in Dec 3rd, although since iPad mini 2 is still FMI on so I had to return it to do Apple ID sign out and then reset (Which I got it back on 14th.). When I checked the XR, I was stunned by how good the previous owner taking care of their phones, it's in a pretty mint conditions, but most importantly, when I go to "About" selection in Settings, I was shocked, not because it's an 128GB model, but it's also still on iOS 13.5! This is the sole reason why I decided to buy this phone from them, despite I actually don't have much interest on this phone ever since its appearances.
