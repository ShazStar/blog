Before we start: I know I already made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ36UD8g7e0&list=PLN-BUs9Cvmoq_uD8xAyjY0BTSv7a4yaSw) about it in Feb 28th, 2021. But I still want to do a write up on this project so let's fucking go.

Some people knows I owned a Mac Pro 2012, it's been my main computer for probably 3 years at this point. In between I already did CPU, GPU, Ram and Disk upgrades but it's not close to what I desired. Around the end of 2020 I finally got a chance to get all the necessery parts for the missing hardware pieces for my Mac Pro. The parts arrived at around the beginning of February.

What's the reason behind this upgrade, you might ask. First, since I completed Apple ecosystem (I have an iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro, Apple Watch) and they works so flawlessly, except my Mac Pro...because the stock Wi-Fi/BT card are **not** supported, second is that this device's USB port all runs at 2.0, which is just painfully slow that I couldn't stand with the speed anymore; Thankfully of how upgradable this beast are so it's really not a complicated task. Sadly this upgradability doesn't exist on most Macs anymore besides the 2019 Mac Pro which are not consumer oriented, the consumer oriented Macs are also doing Apple Silicon transition which basically crushes every possible upgradability.
