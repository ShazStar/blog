Before this start: I know I already made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ36UD8g7e0&list=PLN-BUs9Cvmoq_uD8xAyjY0BTSv7a4yaSw) about it in Feb 28th, 2021. But I still want to do a write up with this so let's fucking go.

Some people knows I owned a Mac Pro 2012, it's been my main computer for probably 3 years at this point. In between I already did CPU, GPU, Ram and Disk upgrades but it's not close to what I desired. Around the end of 2020 I finally got a chance to get all the necessery parts for the missing hardware pieces for my Mac Pro. And this is what pushed me forwarded to did this "Final" upgrade for myself.

So...What's with this upgrade, what's the reason behinds it?

Recently I somewhat got a full set of Apple ecosystems (iPhone / iPad / MacBook Pro / Apple Watch), but since my Mac Pro doesn't have a compatibale Wi-Fi/BT card so it can't do continuity/handoff, that's the first reason, second is that I'm getting tired of how slow USB 2.0 speed are, third and the last reason is that I wanted to reinstall a clean macOS on it, which will be Catalina but since it's not an officially supported device so we have to do some **modifications**, which will be installing OpenCore on it.
